# [National Park VEM](https://vem.web.app/)

## About 
The VEM app is a tool designed to count the number of hikers that pass through a specific trail. The app is intended for use by park rangers, trail maintenance crews, and other individuals responsible for managing hiking trails. I worked on this app with a small team of 2-3 developers at a time.

When a hiker enters the trailhead, the app can be used to count the number of hikers passing through the trail. The app is used to replace an outdated system of using a hand held clicker and tranfering the counts onto a spreadsheet that is then manually put into an Excel file. 

Additionally, the app can be used to generate reports on trail usage, which can be used to inform future trail management decisions.
Overall, the Hiker Counter app is a useful tool for managing hiking trails and ensuring that they remain safe and accessible for all users. This application was made by request of the Supervisor of User Mangement at Zion National Park. The features added were developed to meet Zion NP's specific needs.
